msgstr ""
"O céu noturno sempre atrai nossos olhos. As pessoas erguem os olhos com uma "

"From Earth, the first space-farers spied tiny jewels shining with the light "
"of distant suns, far away but so clear. To reach out and grasp one would "
"only cost a lifetime. Cheap at the price."
msgstr ""
"Da Terra, os primeiros viajantes espaciais avistaram joias minúsculas "
"brilhando com a luz de sóis distantes, porém tão nítidos. Alcançar e agarrar "

"So men and women locked their sleeping bodies into hulking metal boxes. They "
"hurled themselves out into the void. On arrival, they decanted and woke to "
"find new stars staring coldly down from stranger skies."
msgstr ""
"Assim, homens e mulheres trancaram seus corpos adormecidos em enormes caixas "
"de metal. Eles se lançaram no vazio. Na chegada, eles decantaram e acordaram "
"para encontrar novas estrelas olhando friamente para baixo em céus estranhos."

"The first wave of explorers crept from star to star at sublight speeds, "
"until the invention of the hyperspace drive spurred a second growth. Then "
"civilisation spread, as it always has, with exponential enthusiasm -- "
"ripples in the dark sea of space."
msgstr ""
"A primeira onda de exploradores rastejou de estrela em estrela na velocidade "
"da luz, até que a invenção do hiperespaço impulsionou um segundo "
"crescimento. Então a civilização se espalhou, como sempre, com entusiasmo "
"exponencial - ondulações no mar escuro do espaço."

"However, the heroic age of discovery lasted only as long as human curiosity "
"outpaced greed. Too soon, conflict erupted on the colonies. Land, fuel, "
"food, and distrust sowed the seeds of discord. Once begun, the fever of war "
"spread from world to world and became a holocaust."
msgstr ""
"No entanto, a era heróica das descobertas durou apenas enquanto a "
"curiosidade humana superou a ganância. Muito cedo, o conflito eclodiu nas "
"colônias. Terra, combustível, comida e desconfiança semearam as sementes da "
"discórdia. Uma vez iniciada, a febre da guerra espalhou-se de mundo a mundo "
"e tornou-se um holocausto."

"A man named Daedris asserted dominion over the exhausted worlds. He founded "

msgstr ""
"Um homem chamado Daedris afirmou domínio sobre os mundos exaustos. Ele "
"fundou um Império Galáctico e se nomeou seu governante. Sob o punho de ferro "

"Scholars call it the zenith: technology leapt forward, culture flourished, "

msgstr ""
"Os estudiosos chamam isso de zênite: a tecnologia deu um salto à frente, a "

#: dat/intro:21
msgid ""
"After Daedris, under his successors, the light of the empire waned. Civil "
"strife and religious division weakened social bonds. The great projects of "
"the imperium went awry. In some regions, administration fell into the hands "
"of other powers. The Great Houses now policed the space lanes."
msgstr ""
"Depois de Daedris, sob seus sucessores, a luz do império diminuiu. Conflitos "
"civis e divisões religiosas enfraqueceram os laços sociais. Os grandes "
"projetos do imperium deram errado. Em algumas regiões, a administração caiu "
"nas mãos de outros poderes. As Grandes Casas agora policiavam as vias "

"From Earth, a cataclysmic explosion ripped through space, annihilating "

msgstr ""
"Da Terra, uma explosão cataclísmica rasgou o espaço, aniquilando estrelas, "

"We know this base is located somewhere in the nebula, and we have recently "

"    One of the walls lights up, showing part of the galaxy map. The %s "
"system is colored red, and it's pulsating gently.\n"
"    \"Of course, we have conducted patrols in this system, but so far "
"without result. Our sensors are severely impaired by the nebula in this "
"system, so the chances of us finding the terrorist hive by our own devices "
"are slim. Fortunately, our top strategists have come up with a ruse, one "
"that will make the FLF come to us.\"\n"
"    \"We will use a civilian ship - your ship, naturally - as a decoy,\" "
"Urnus continues. The image on the wall zooms up to the %s system, and a "
"white blip representing your ship appears near the jump point. \"Your ship "
"will be equipped with an IFF transponder in use by the FLF, so to anyone who "
"isn't looking too closely you will appear as an FLF ship. Of course, this "
"alone is not enough. The FLF will assume you know where their base is, since "
"you look like one of them. It is important to note that the transponder will "
"work best in the Nebula, which we believe is where the base should be "
"located.\"\n"
"    The image on the wall updates again, this time showing several House "
"Dvaered crests near your ship.\n"
"    \"Some time after you enter the system, several of our military assets "
"will jump in and open fire. To the FLF, it will look like one of their own "
"has come under attack! Since their base is nearby, they will undoubtedly "
"send reinforcements to help their 'comrade' out of a tight situation.\""

"ship's computer and download the flight log, which should contain the "
"location of the FLF base. Take this information to a Dvaered base, and your "
"mission will be complete.\"\n"
"    The image on the wall updates one last time, simulating the battle as "
"described by Colonel Urnus. Several FLF logos appear, which are promptly "
"surrounded by the Dvaered ones. Then the logos turn gray, indicating that "
"they've been disabled.\n"

"do NOT disable or destroy any Dvaered ships, and make sure your own armor "
"takes a bit of a beating. This is vital to the success of the mission. Do "

#. An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.

#. MISSION: Defend the System 1
#. DESCRIPTION: A mission to defend the system against swarm of pirate ships.
#. This will be the first in a planned series of random encounters.
#. After the third specifically scripted pirate invasion, a militia will form.
#. The player will have the option to join the militia.
#. Perhaps the random missions will eventually lead on to a plot line relating to the pirates.
#.
#. Notable events:
#.
#. * Stage one: From the bar, the player learns of a pirate fleet attacking the system and joins a defense force.
#. * Stage two: The volunteer force attacks the pirates.
#. * Stage three: When a sufficient number have been killed, the pirates retreat.
#. * Stage four: The portmaster welcomes the fleet back and thanks them with money.
#. * Stage five: In the bar afterward, another pilot wonders why the pirates behaved unusually.
#.
#. TO DO
#. Add some consequences if the player aborts the mission

#. He's getting old and wants to go to space before he dies. He owns a hot dog

"pushed out of Frontier space, and we would be crushed in that market between "
"House Dvaered and House Sirius. Sure, the FLF would still be using a few "
"Pacifiers, but it would be a token business at best, and not to mention the "

#. Description: A prototype drone runs away and needs to be caught by the player
#. How to make this more interesting than just go to a system and shoot down the drone w ion or medusa? The ship has to have enough cargo for the drone to be transported back.
#. So the player has to hail the drone bc the scientist wants to patch the software which fails and the drone causes other drones to attack.
#. I was thinking of player having to use electronic warfare. But is there a way to check that?

#. Rescue script for stranded pilots.
#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.
#.
#. --
#. Slots that must be filled in order to take off.
#. Outfits equipped in required slots.
#. Array of empty required slots and their default outfits.
#. Whether the player opted to stop the script.
#.
#.
#. Determines whether the player is stranded.
#.
#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.
#.
#. --
#. Player has no ability to fix whatever's wrong, definitely stuck.
#. Get value of player's ship.
#. If the player can afford another ship, they're not stranded.
#. When all cores are equipped along with non-cores, it's nearly impossible
#. to determine where the problem lies, so let the player sort it out.
#. Add the player's other ships' outfits.
#. Add outfits sold by the outfitter.

"exclusively by volunteers and it gives us all great joy to know that there "
"are others who love this game as much as we do!\n"
"    Of course, please note that this is an incomplete game. You will "
"encounter dead ends to storylines, missing storylines, and possibly even "
"some bugs, although we try to keep those to a minimum of course. So be "
"prepared for some rough edges for the time being. That said, we are working "
"on this game every day and hope to one day finish this massive project on "
"our hands. Perhaps you could become one of us, who knows?\n"
"    For more information about the game and its development state, take a "
"look at naev.org; it has all the relevant links. And again, thank you for "
